Codes that I had to for my object oriented programming class in C++ are in this folder as well as comments explaning how i came up with certain fucntions. 
Here is the reason behind writing each one of theses codes: 

1D 8Queens: I needed to use a 1d array to to represent a chess board and look for 8 different locations on that chessboard(8x8) that no two queens killed each other. 

2D 8Queens: I used a 2d array to represent a cheessboard and here i also need to find 8 different locations on the chessboard(8x8) that no two queens would hurt each other. (USED GOTO'S)

Eight Numbers: The reason for this code to to write 8 numbers in a way that the boxes that are tocuhing it directly don't contain a consecutive number. 

Integration: This code is to find the area underneath a curve from two finite positions. (USED TYPEDEF)

Nqueens: For this code i didn't know the number of queens on a certain chessboard whose dimensions are nxn.(USED DYNAMIC MEMORY)

Stable Marriage: The purpose of this code was to have a certain man and a certain woman together based on there ranking of one another. These couples had to be created in a way that no one would want to cheat on there spouse.
